# Changelog

Notable changes to Siberian, newest first. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`. Longer notes live in `docs/`.

## [Unreleased] on branch `feat-module-updates` (not released)

### Added

- 2026-10-25 Module updates in the backoffice (Settings > Updates & Modules). Siberian checks the downloader's single cached module list, compares versions on its own server, and lists licensed modules that have a newer version. Design and decisions: `docs/module-updates.md`.
  - `Siberian\ModuleUpdates`: conditional fetch of the list (ETag), daily refresh, last good list served for up to 7 days when the downloader is down, version comparison, live terms and their acceptance, verified download.
  - The administrator must accept the terms of download inside Siberian. The terms are served live by the downloader; when their hash changes, Siberian asks again.
  - Updates need both licence keys (Siberian and module). Packages come back signed (Ed25519) with a sha256; both are verified against a pinned public key before anything is written. A package that is not newer than the installed module is refused.
  - New backoffice actions `checkupdates`, `terms`, `acceptterms` (POST), `updatemodule` (POST). `updatemodule` hands the verified package to the existing installer steps (details, permissions, copy, install).
  - Daily cron job "Module updates check" (time differs per installation), module `Installer` 4.8.8.
  - Kill switch: set `module_updates_enabled` to `0` in the settings.
- 2026-10-25 Tests in `tests/php-upgrade/regression/ModuleUpdatesTest.php` (24 checks, PHP 8.5.12).

### Security

- 2026-10-25 The update client always verifies TLS certificates (TLS 1.2 minimum, https only, no redirects, response size cap). `Siberian\License` is unchanged and still has verification off, see `docs/module-updates.md`.
- 2026-10-25 Downloads are refused until a signing key is pinned (`ModuleUpdates::PINNED_KEYS` or the `module_updates_public_keys` setting), so licence keys never leave for an unverifiable service.
